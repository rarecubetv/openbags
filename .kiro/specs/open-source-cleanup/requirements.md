# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive Bags SDK toolkit that provides both CLI and web interface capabilities for creating Solana tokens with fee sharing functionality. The goal is to clean up and prepare this project for open source release by removing sensitive information, improving documentation, organizing the codebase, and ensuring it follows open source best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an open source contributor, I want the project to have a clean, well-organized structure so that I can easily understand and contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL have a clear separation between CLI tools and web UI components
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL contain no sensitive information like API keys, private keys, or personal data
3. WHEN looking at the file organization THEN the system SHALL have logical grouping of related functionality
4. IF there are duplicate or unnecessary files THEN the system SHALL remove them to reduce clutter

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation and setup instructions
2. WHEN following the quick start guide THEN the system SHALL allow me to get the project running within 5 minutes
3. WHEN exploring the API THEN the system SHALL have complete API documentation with examples
4. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the project to follow security best practices so that I can safely use it in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining environment variables THEN the system SHALL use .env.example with placeholder values only
2. WHEN reviewing the .gitignore THEN the system SHALL prevent committing sensitive files
3. WHEN looking at the code THEN the system SHALL not contain hardcoded credentials or private keys
4. WHEN using the wallet functionality THEN the system SHALL only use client-side signing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the build and deployment process to be standardized so that the project can be easily maintained and released.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm scripts THEN the system SHALL have consistent and logical script names
2. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL have no build errors or warnings
3. WHEN testing the project THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive test coverage
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL have clear deployment instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an open source user, I want to understand the project's purpose and capabilities so that I can determine if it meets my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the project THEN the system SHALL have a clear description of its purpose and features
2. WHEN exploring examples THEN the system SHALL provide working code examples for common use cases
3. WHEN reviewing the license THEN the system SHALL have appropriate open source licensing
4. WHEN looking at the project structure THEN the system SHALL indicate which components are essential vs optional

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose between CLI and web UI approaches so that I can use the method that best fits my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality through command line interface
2. WHEN using the web UI THEN the system SHALL provide the same core functionality through a modern web interface
3. WHEN choosing an approach THEN the system SHALL clearly document the benefits of each method
4. IF I only need one approach THEN the system SHALL allow me to use just the CLI or just the UI independently
